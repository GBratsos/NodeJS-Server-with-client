NodeJS-Server-with-client
=========================

This is a NodeJS working Server with JSON url get/post for non-CORS servers.

It uses AngularJS and Zurb Foundation for rendering the JSON files.

At the bottom of the /routes/json.js edit the url of the JSON fileyou want to get.

Big thanks to Antonis Tsiapaliokas.
